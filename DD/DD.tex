	\section{Architectural Design}
		\subsection{Overview}
		This section of the design document provides a general description of the design of the system
		and its processes. The \pej system will follows the "event-driven" and "client-server" architectural style, there will be a thin client and a fat server and the interaction between the components takes place through asynchronous events. The \pej system will be implemented using JEE following a multi-tier architecture as shown in the picture below. In according to the philosophy of divide and conquer, the choice of a multi-tier architecture is motivated by the flexibility and the reusability of the application. In fact developers, by segregating an application into tiers, acquire the option of modifying or adding a specific layer, instead of reworking the entire application. Furthermore the simplicity of the design and implementation of this architecture allows an easy integration with the old custom ERP.
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{"img/architecture"}
		\end{center}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textit{Client Tier}: contains Application Clients and Web Browsers and it is the layer designed to interact with the users. In our case it includes the browser and the mobile application.
			\item \textit{Java EE Server Tier}: contains the Servlets and Dynamic Web Pages that need to be elaborated and the Java Beans, which contain the business logic of the application.
			\item \textit{MOM Tier}: contains a Message Oriented Middleware based on Java Message Service that allows an easier integration of the legacy ERP and also permit to have loosely coupled components that can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services.
			\item \textit{EIS Tier}: contains the data source. In our case, there is a database and the legacy ERP that both are allowed to manipulate and to retrieve relevant data.
		\end{enumerate}
		\pagebreak
		
		\subsection{General Component view and interactions}
			\subsubsection{General Package Design}
			Considering the chosen architecture, it can be identified the following packages:
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{"img/package-design"}
			\end{center}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User Interface
				\item Business Logic
				\item Message Oriented Middleware
				\item Persistence Manager
				\item CSGestion
			\end{itemize}
			All users, as shown in the picture above, can not directly access all packages except for the ui.
			\subsubsection{Detailed Package Design}
			The inner packages are described as follows:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item User Interface: set of sub-packages responsible of user's interactions and of forwarding information requests to the Business Logic sub-packages.
				\item Business Logic: set of sub-packages responsible for handling requests from the User Interface package, process requests and send back a result. These packages may access the Message Oriented Middleware package.
				\item Message Oriented Middleware: set of sub-packages prepared to be an intermediary between Persistence Manager, Legacy ERP and the Business Logic package.
				\item Persistence Manager: set of sub-packages contains the data model for the system. It accepts requests from the Message Oriented Middleware package.
				\item CSGestion:  set of sub-packages that represent the legacy ERP of the company (
				for more information see CSGestion documentation).
			\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Selected architectural styles, patterns and other design decisions}
		The decision of using the client-server architecture is motivated by cost savings. In fact the company wants to use its server that already have. However, the \pej application is also designed to be implemented in a cloud architecture. In the future cloud architecture may be the best solution. In fact though the expected workload is static in case of a heavy load increase the cloud architecture offers an elastic scaling  (see the figure below).\\
		\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
			\vspace{5mm}
			\makebox[\linewidth]{
				\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,scale=4.5]{"img/static-workload-sketch"}}
			\vspace{5mm}
		\end{minipage}
		Some software design patterns are used in the design of the system, for instance the Factory method pattern is used for the creation of instances for Reservations and the Profiles, while the Singleton pattern is used for Car Manager.\\
		The system have to be always fast and responsive, also in case of a high number of requests and accesses to the service at the same time, for this reason parallelization is highly used;
		\pagebreak
		
	\section{Algorithm Design}
	Follows some distinctive algorithms of \pej. All algorithms are presented with pseudocode and
	flowchart diagrams.
		\subsection{Payment} \label{sec:payment}
		Follows the payment algorithm. It represents how the system calculate and deducts money from the payments method chosen by the user. This algorithm is part of Payment Manager component. It gets all the reservation's informations, calculate the payment with the function cost (see below for more details) and sends the payment summary. It interacts with the Reservation Manager, with the MOM and the Notification component.
		
			\subsubsection{Cost Function}
			There are different functions cost, one for each case:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Non Shared Ride
				\item Shared Ride
				\item Fees
			\end{itemize}
			
			\paragraph{Non Shared Ride}
			This function is chosen in case of a non shared ride.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textit{t}: movement time
					\item \textit{N}: number of seats occupied during the ride (for at least 50\% of the movement time)
					\item \textit{k}: hourly cost float constant [\euro/hour]
				\end{itemize}
				\begin{equation}
					f_{cost}(t)= 
					\begin{cases}
					{kt},& N < 3\\
					{kt(0.9)},& N \geq 3
					\end{cases}
				\end{equation}
			
			\paragraph{Shared Ride}
			This function is chosen in case of a shared ride. It is calculated for each \textit{i}-th registered user that take part to the ride.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textit{t}: movement time
					\item \textit{N}: number of seats occupied during the ride (for at least 50\% of the movement time)
					\item \textit{n}: number of seats occupied by registered user
					\item \textit{k}: hourly cost float constant [\euro/hour]
					\item \textit{S}: scale factor
				\end{itemize}
				
				\begin{equation}
					S_{i} = \dfrac {n}{N}
				\end{equation}
				
				\begin{equation}
					{f_{cost}}_{i}(t)= 
					\begin{cases}
					{S_{i}kt},& N < 3\\
					{S_{i}kt(0.9)},& N \geq 3
					\end{cases}
				\end{equation}
				
			\paragraph{Fees} This function is calculated when the system have to discourage bad behavior (i.e. the driver do not pick-up the car within one hour from the reservation). It is time invariant.
				\begin{equation}
				f_{cost}= \text{const} 
				\end{equation}

		\subsection{Good car distribution} \label{sec:carDistribution}
		Follows the car distribution algorithm. It represents how the system allocates to handymand operators cars to be moved. It interacts with the MOM to get cars that have to be moved, the initial and the final location for each auto.
