		\subsection{Document Purpose}
		This document aims to describe in a complete way the application that will be developed and the domain in which it will be performed.\\
		The target audience of this document are analysts, project managers, developers, testers and final users.\\
		\textbf{Important!} This document has a contract validity between the costumer and the company that will develop the application.
		
		\subsection{Product Scope}
		\subsubsection{Actual system}
		Until now the car sharing company has a system where a registered client can reserve an electric car by calling a call-center. The service registration cannot be done on-line. It can only be done in the company office with a specific module. The company has a software called "\csg" that is a custom ERP, and it's used for managing all company cars. The software stores all the informations into a database.
		
		\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.35\textwidth}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{"img/eletronic-card"}
			\caption{\label{fig:eletronic-card} The electronic card obtained upon registration.}
		\end{wrapfigure}
		Data such as position, battery power and occupied seats are read by an on-board computer on every car and transmitted via cellular connection to the software. All data between the software \csg and each auto are transmitted using a VPN for better security on sensitive data.
		All customers requests are handled by the call-center of the company. An operator after a client request reserves the auto at most for one hour. The driver have to use an electronic card (
		obtained upon registration) for open the car. After the car is unlocked, the driver can turn on the machine by entering the user key (obtained upon registration) in the on-board computer and pushing the ignition button.
		When the driver leaves the car not in a safe area and gets out the car, can lock and unlock the car using the electronic card (Figure \ref{fig:eletronic-card}).
		After the use, when the driver gets out the car after leaving it in a safe area, the car will automatically lock.
		If the driver leaves the car in a safe area the payment of the service is automatically made by the registered client credit card and the car can be used by another customer.
		For whatever exception the client have to call the call-center.
		In case of accident it is provided that the car involved warns the system of the accident.
		A call-center operator will follow the practice and will notify to the company that deals with repairs.
		To ensure the proper functioning of the system the company hired employees (Handyman Operators) which in collaboration with the call-center recharges low battery cars and move cars from a safe area to another to ensure that in each area there is the minimum number of cars available.
			
		\subsubsection{Scope} \label{sec:scope}
		\pej is a new web and native mobile application thought to improve existing car sharing service. In particular \pej is focused to reduce unnecessary calls to the call-center, to facilitate the work of handyman operators, to simplify user ways to access to the service (for example using the smartphone to lock/unlock the booked car or provide an on-line registration) and advertise the car sharing service.

		\subsubsection{Definitions}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Visitor (or Guest): is a non-registered user.
				\item User (or Registered User, or Client, or Driver): is the user of the application that wants to use the car sharing service.
				\item Passenger: is a person that use a car of the service that is not a driver. He/She has no obligation to be registered to the service.
				\item Location: are the GPS coordinates to identify a place. It could be the position of a car.
				\item Car (or Auto, or Transport): is a machine that belongs to the car sharing company.
				\item Safe area (or Equipped Parking): is a parking area defined in collaboration with the municipal administration equipped with charging towers for company cars. Every parking is unattended and for safety reasons equipped with CCTV.
				\item CSGestion: is an existing software used by call-center operators for managing all company cars. It allows to know for every car: car status (Available, Busy or Not working), the percentage of battery charge and the number of seats occupied.
				\item Lock/Unlock a car: it's means to lock/unlock the car door and deny/allow to a person to get in/out the car.

			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Identifying Stakeholders}
		The main direct stakeholders of this project are the Municipality of Milan and the car sharing company that together have funded the renovation of the transport service. When the application will be on-line other stakeholders will be some company employees and final users that will provide a feedback of the new system.
		\subsection{Identifying Actors}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Registered Users: are the final users of the car sharing service. Only they can book a car by calling the call-center or by using the web or mobile app, and use it.
				\item Passenger: is a registered user that can reserve a number of seats of a shared ride using the\\ \pej application.
				\item Handyman Operator: is a company employee that recharges low battery cars and move cars from a safe area to another to ensure that in each area there is the minimum number of cars available.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Goals} \label{sec:goals}
		\input{includes/goals.tex}
		
		\subsection{Proposed system}
		The new system will not replace the old one, it will be integrate with it. The proposed solution will be implemented in a client-server architecture and consists in a software composed by a website and a mobile application. Both parts communicate with a server which runs the business logic and accesses the DBMS. Both parts will be developed from scratch. The web version should be responsive for a better view on mobile devices. The native mobile version will be developed for iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

		\subsection{Non Functional Requirements}
			\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
			To ensure an high level of usability of the service it is important to calibrate the server resources. The objective is to avoid a deadlock due to the overload in situations of heavy loads.
			\subsubsection{Availability \& Reliability}
			The system must guarantee an availability of 98\%. The application will be hosted by multiple redundant servers to prevent service failures due to hardware faults. All servers will be equipped with an autonomous power supply backup system.
			
			\subsubsection{Security}
			All the communications between servers and clients must be protected by strong encryption using the SSL protocol. Users' passwords must not be stored in plain text in the database. The application must generate a snapshot of the last 10 days system's state.
			
			\subsubsection{Maintainability}
			When finished the software will not require any particular update except for security fix and the maintenance for APIs offered by the system. The code should be well documented to help developers to understand and edit it quickly.
